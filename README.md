# Vanilla Main Menu

Have you ever opened up Outer Wilds after the release of Echoes of the Eye and thought: "Man, this new logo really ruins the aesthetic and color palette of the main menu for me"? Well fear not, for "Vanilla Main Menu" fixes this issue by removing the Echoes of the Eye logo from the main title screen, and doing absolutely nothing else! Wow! 

## Features:

- Removes the Echoes of the Eye logo from the main title screen for those who own EotE (already removed by default for non-DLC owners).

- Is the smallest and most lightweight mod in the entire Outer Wilds mod library (probably).

- Is compatible with every other mod.
